# My basic Flask app code skeleton

In this repo, you will find the basic structure of a Flask app. There are some files in the `app` folder with boilerplate code to manage a database and to create a very basic Flask app. There are all the HTML and CSS files in the `static`and `templates` folders. The `index.html` contains a demo page using the CSS classes in the `styles.css`file.  

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/flask-app-skeleton.git ./your-app-folder
cd ./your-app-folder
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
And you are ready to go!  

__*Make sure to have python3 and pip3 installed.*__
